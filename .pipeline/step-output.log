Perfect! I've written a comprehensive reflection for Phase 1. Let me create a brief summary of what I've delivered:

# Phase 1 Reflection Complete

I've written the reflection document to `docs/phases/phase-1/REFLECTIONS.md`. Here's what it covers:

## Key Highlights

### What Went Well ✅
- Clean greenfield start with solid R package foundation
- Comprehensive documentation (AGENTS.md) enables instant developer productivity
- 100% test coverage with meaningful assertions (no mock abuse)
- Realistic sample data with tenure-based variance
- Iterative review-fix cycle caught 5 critical issues before they propagated

### What Didn't Work ❌
- Test runner initially misconfigured (tried to load uninstalled package)
- Missing rprojroot dependency ("works on my machine" problem)
- Weak test assertions (used `is.numeric()` when should use `is.integer()`)
- .gitignore polluted with irrelevant Node.js patterns
- Profile distribution test too permissive (accepted any distribution >10%)

### All Issues Fixed
All 5 critical and 2 minor issues identified in REVIEW.md were systematically addressed in MUST-FIX.md and verified working.

## Phase 2 Recommendations

The reflection provides **specific, actionable guidance** for Phase 2:

1. **Scope**: Build scoring engine with normalization + configurable weights (no UI yet)
2. **Priorities**: Normalization functions first → weight configuration → score calculation
3. **Vertical slice**: Script that loads CSV, calculates scores, outputs scored CSV
4. **Process improvements**: Validate PLAN assumptions early, document "why" for non-obvious decisions

## Technical Debt Tracked

Documented 4 low-risk items for future attention:
- No integration test for CSV generation script
- No boundary tests for edge inputs (n_reps=0, negatives)
- Simple data generation model (sufficient for Phase 1, may need sophistication later)
- No CI configuration yet (manual testing sufficient for now)

**The reflection clearly states Phase 1 is COMPLETE and Phase 2 should build the scoring engine next.**
