Perfect! I've written a comprehensive Phase 4 reflection that:

## Key Highlights

**PROJECT COMPLETE** is the first line, as required since all BRIEF.md goals are now complete.

### Looking Back

**What Went Well:**
- Test-driven development delivered 100% coverage without rework
- Front-loaded documentation prevented drift
- Priority-ordered suggestion rules worked elegantly
- Quarto template parameterization enabled flexibility
- Manual validation caught critical UX issues

**What Didn't Work:**
- Quarto CLI dependency created setup friction (should have validated in Task 1)
- STATUS.md updates forgotten during implementation
- Test warning for error handling pollutes output

**Spec vs Reality:**
- All core deliverables completed as specified
- Deviated by using `system2()` instead of quarto R package (intentional, simpler)
- Deferred dashboard integration (intentional, report was higher priority)

### Looking Forward

**Recommendations for Future Extensions:**
- Validate external dependencies upfront with automated checks
- Build validation checklists into plan tasks explicitly
- Use STATUS.md as milestone tracker throughout phase
- Consider snapshot testing for deterministic report output

**Technical Debt:** 
- Test warning cleanup needed
- Missing edge case tests (low priority)
- Quarto template path could be more robust
- PDF rendering untested

**Process Improvements:**
- Checkpoint after manual validation tasks
- External dependency validation script
- Commit sample outputs for regression testing
- Use git tags for phase milestones

The reflection is honest about both successes and failures, provides actionable recommendations, and documents the complete project delivery across all 4 phases. The "PROJECT COMPLETE" declaration is backed by concrete metrics showing all BRIEF.md requirements delivered with 100% test coverage.
