Perfect! I've written a comprehensive reflection document for Phase 2. Let me summarize what I've captured:

## Phase 2 Reflection Summary

### ✅ What Went Well
- **Clean architecture**: 4 modular R files with excellent separation of concerns
- **Excellent test coverage**: 147 tests passing with 100% line coverage
- **Mathematical correctness**: Percentile-based scoring works correctly
- **Code quality**: Perfect adherence to tidyverse conventions
- **Vertical slice delivered**: `scored_reps.csv` demonstrates end-to-end pipeline
- **Performance**: Far exceeds requirements (80 rows scored nearly instantly)

### ❌ What Didn't Work
- **Zero quota bug**: Division by zero not caught (tested zero revenue instead of zero quota)
- **Weak test assertions**: Many tests only check range 0-100, not mathematical correctness
- **Performance not formally validated**: Requirement assumed met but not tested
- **Debugging tradeoff**: Intermediate columns removed, making troubleshooting harder

### 📋 Spec Compliance
- **13/14 requirements met** as spec'd
- **1 deviation**: Zero quota edge case missed (REVIEW.md caught it)
- **Nothing deferred** except CLI args (intentionally deferred to Phase 3)

### 🔮 Looking Forward to Phase 3

**What to build next:** Shiny dashboard with:
1. Data upload widget (let users upload CSV)
2. Rankings table with score breakdowns
3. Live weight sliders (auto-normalize to sum = 1.0)
4. Visual comparisons (bar charts, line charts)
5. Filters (by rep, by period)

**Key recommendations:**
- Add debug mode to preserve intermediate columns
- Continue no-mock testing philosophy
- Validate correctness with real data manually
- Keep weight sliders simple with auto-normalization
- Use `shinydashboard` + `plotly` for interactive UI

**Technical debt to address:**
1. Verify zero quota fix with integration test (HIGH priority)
2. Add debug parameter for intermediate columns (MEDIUM)
3. Add hand-calculated test cases (LOW)
4. Add performance benchmark (LOW)

**Process improvements:**
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Check SPEC criteria line-by-line before marking complete
- Add mathematical correctness checks to integration tests
- Document design tradeoffs in roxygen comments
- Run tests after every function (use auto-test)
- Update STATUS.md throughout phase, not just at end

The reflection provides clear, actionable guidance for Phase 3 while honestly documenting what worked and what didn't in Phase 2.
