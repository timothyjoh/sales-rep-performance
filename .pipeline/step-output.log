Perfect! I've completed the Phase 3 reflection document. Let me provide a summary of what I found:

## Phase 3 Reflection Summary

I've analyzed Phase 3 and written a comprehensive reflection to `docs/phases/phase-3/REFLECTIONS.md`. Here are the key findings:

### 🎯 What Went Well

1. **Iterative execution** — Following the 10-task PLAN delivered clean, testable code incrementally
2. **Debug mode success** — Adding `debug = TRUE` parameter to scoring solved Phase 2's technical debt
3. **Performance excellent** — 44ms for 1000 rows (well under 500ms requirement)
4. **Helper tests caught bugs** — 100% coverage with 190 passing test assertions
5. **Documentation complete** — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md all updated

### ⚠️ What Didn't Work

1. **Weight slider UX incomplete** — Sliders normalize for scoring but don't visually update to show the user the normalized values
2. **E2E tests skipped** — All 8 shinytest2 tests exist but skip with "On CRAN" reason (0% integration coverage)
3. **Dependency issues** — plotly in `Suggests` but used as hard dependency; ggplot2 missing from imports
4. **STATUS.md not updated** — Still shows "Step: build" instead of "complete"

### 📊 Spec Compliance: 13/16 Acceptance Criteria Met (81%)

The core functionality works — the dashboard launches, scores calculate correctly, filters work, export functions properly. The gaps are around polish (slider UI feedback), test infrastructure (E2E tests not running), and documentation completeness.

### 🔮 Looking Forward: Phase 4 Should Build

Based on BRIEF.md, Phase 4 should deliver:

1. **Quarto Executive Report** — Static HTML/PDF with top performers, trends, score distributions
2. **Improvement Suggestions Engine** — Rules-based recommendations (e.g., "high activity but low conversion → needs skill coaching")

**Priority**: Fix test infrastructure and dependency issues before starting Phase 4, since future phases may add more Shiny features requiring working E2E tests.

The reflection document is comprehensive (~280 lines) with specific file references, code examples, and actionable recommendations for the next phase.
